<p style="font-size: 25px;align-content: center; color: maroon">How it Works</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Your child will be given a file with all the work they will be expected to cover over the 12 hours. Every day you will be able to log on to your child’s own Learning Zone to check on their progress and read a daily report. We do understand that sometimes children cannot take everything in, so we provide worked answers and back up videos for you and your child so that once the course is over you can continue to study together.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Book your course online now or contact our office on 0800 917 4194 to secure your child’s place
